2. To start it use index.html.
3. Internet connection required as bootstrap used for styling.

Use of Bootstrap provides dynamic adaptation to window size. So it makes app properly visible on all devices.

New options (calculations) might be added in further development.

Main idea for the app is to keep it fast and simple providing handy tool for every handyman 
opposite to overcomplicated construction software. 
Additional option of customer database provides fast and simple note like tool letting user to write customers details down
without leaving the app.

Scenario 1 -  Kevin is meeting new customer to provide estimates

Situation

Customer wants him to lay the tiles in his 2 bathrooms, kitchen walls and floors and also hall floor an outside terrace.
Obviously works require different tiles for every place. 
Kevin brings tile catalogues to let the customer choose from.
Then it has to be calculated how many tiles they need and how much it would cost.
Kevin usually does all the calculations manually which requires a lot of attention, is time consuming and is error prone.
He’s already been in the situation that he made it wrong and then had to talk to customer that the actual price is different.
That kind of situation caused the customer lost trust in him and once even resigned and put bad review on the internet.

It’s pretty straightforward and easy to use. 
It requires clicking the right option and putting some data in and all the calculations are done with one click. 
Using an app Kevin looks professional and inspires customer’s confidence.
